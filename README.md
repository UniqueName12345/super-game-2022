# Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, food

NOTE: This is the readme file.

This _was_ going to be a game parodying those pirate multicarts, but the AI decided to make it a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, food

## Description

RPS, but with lizards and food.

## Rules

You know the basic rules of RPS, but you also have to know that:

- Rock squishes lizard, but paper covers rock.
- Lizard eats paper and food, but scissors cuts lizard.
- Food and rocks blunts scissors, but lizard eats paper and food.

## Scoring

For every round against the computer the player wins, the player gets a point.

For every round against the computer the computer loses, the player loses a point and the computer gets a point.

Pretty simple, but you got to know how to play.

## Gameplay

To control yourself, type in R for rock, P for paper, S for scissors, L for lizard, or F for food.

The computer chooses randomly from the options.

## Credits

Thanks to myself, CoPilot and Clippy AI.
